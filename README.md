#About the project
The project works to collect data regarding stocks.
For most people it is difficult to go on a website related to stock market and get the desired information as the websites are filled with different types of data and they don't know which information is useful for them and which is not.
This script takes the name of the stocks from user , search for the stocks on the website of BSE one by one and collects the data like the current value of the stock , the low and high of the day, lowest and highest of 52 weeks(an year) and upper price band . lower price band , turnover etc.
The collected data will be stored in a json file and can be later extracted for use.
